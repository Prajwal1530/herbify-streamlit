# HERBIFY - MEDICINAL PLANT DETECTION 🌿

A simple Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based website that detects medicinal plants.

## DISCLAIMER ⚠️

This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) and comes with no guarantees from the creator. It is not intended for real-world application. The creator bears no responsibility for any use of the project. However, this project showcases the potential of ML/DL in identifying medicinal plants if developed on a larger scale with clean and extensive data.

## MOTIVATION 💪

- Developing a tool for ensuring the authenticity and quality of raw materials used in Ayurvedic medicine.
- Creating an accurate and user-friendly system for identifying various medicinal plants to reduce the risk of misidentification.
- Making the software accessible to all stakeholders in the supply chain, from wholesalers to distributors.

## DATA SOURCE 📊

**Medicinal Plant Dataset**

## Notebooks 📚

*Note: The corresponding code will be uploaded to Kaggle Notebooks soon.*

## Built with 🛠️

- **Python, Streamlit** for the web interface.
- **TensorFlow, CNN** for model development.
- **NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib** for data processing and analysis.
- **Git** for version control.
- **Streamlit** for deployment.

## DEPLOYMENT 🚀

The website is deployed and accessible [here](#). *Note: The website may take a minute to load sometimes due to server hibernation.*

## How to Use 🖥️

**Medicinal Plant Detection**: Upload an image of a plant, and wait for the model to predict its classification.

## How to Run Locally 🛠️

1. **Clone the complete project**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Prajwal1530/herbify-streamlit.git
   ```

   *or you can just download the code and unzip it.*

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```sh
   python -m venv herbify-env
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     herbify-env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```sh
     source herbify-env/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required packages**:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the application**:

   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
